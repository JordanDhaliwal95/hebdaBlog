          <h1>Our Services</h1>
            <p>We strive to provide you with complete health dentistry.</p>
        </div>
        <ul id="services_list">
          <li>
            <h2>Bonding/White Fillings</h2>
            <div class="picture"></div>
            <p>Bonding is a popular method to enhance the aesthetics of your smile. Bonding can be used to correct cracks or gaps in teeth, as a filling after a cavity has been removed, or to cover up stains or discolored teeth.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Bridges</h2>
            <div class="picture2"></div>
            <p>Bonding is a popular method to enhance the aesthetics of your smile. Bonding can be used to correct cracks or gaps in teeth, as a filling after a cavity has been removed, or to cover up stains or discolored teeth.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Crowns</h2>
            <div class="picture3"></div>
            <p>Over time our teeth begin to weaken and become more susceptible to problems such as decay, cracks, discoloration and others. If you feel your smile isnâ€™t what it once was, crowns can help you recover your smile. If your dentist notices that a tooth is decayed or seems weakened/cracked a crown may be necessary to make sure that there are no additional problems with the tooth. In cases like this a filling or bonding will not be sufficient.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Hygiene/Periodontal</h2>
            <div class="picture4"></div>
            <p>While at our office, we make sure that you receive the highest level of service and ensure that our dental work is of the highest quality. To ensure that you maintain great oral health, this level of quality needs to extend into your personal oral hygiene routine. We can help you establish a dental hygiene routine that will keep your teeth healthy and white. If you have any questions about your current hygiene plan please ask us.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Teeth Whitening</h2>
            <div class="picture5"></div>
            <p>Keeping our teeth their whitest is a lot harder than it sounds. With all the coffee, wine, smoking and other foods that have the ability to stain our teeth on a daily basis, even proper maintenance sometimes leaves them a little lackluster. Teeth whitening is an excellent way to restore the natural color of your teeth or even make them whiter than your natural color if you would like.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Zoom Whitening</h2>
            <div class="picture6"></div>
            <p>To accomplish the whitening of your teeth, we utilize a product called ZOOM!. ZOOM! is a chairside whitening procedure that uses a safe whitening gel and a low intensity light to activate the gel. This combination allows us to provide you with teeth that are 6-10 shades whiter in about an hour!</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Veneers</h2>
            <div class="picture7"></div>
            <p>Veneers are an excellent way to redesign and reshape your entire mouth. Veneers are a very thin ceramic shell that covers your existing tooth structure. In placing these new veneers on your teeth, you are able to fix the look of issues such as staining, cracked teeth, spaces, misaligned teeth, chipped teeth and many other issues.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Dental Implants</h2>
            <div class="picture8"></div>
            <p>Dental implants are a permanent and appealing solution to replace missing or extracted teeth. They are better than other alternatives like bridges because no additional teeth need to be altered to place the new tooth.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Invisalign</h2>
            <div class="picture9"></div>
            <p>Invisalign is a new system of straightening teeth without the use of conventional braces. A series of clear plastic aligners are utilized to create tooth movement.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Inlays/Onlays</h2>
            <div class="picture10"></div>
            <p>Inlays and onlays are often referred to as partial crowns. They use the existing tooth as a base and fit the inlay or onlay onto the tooth. This is done to strengthen the tooth, restore its shape, and prevent further damage. An inlay is done when there is no damage to the cusps of the tooth and the inlay can be placed right on the tooth. An inlay is used when the damage is a little more extensive.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Oral Cancer Screen</h2>
            <div class="picture11"></div>
            <p>Oral cancer screenings are a very important part of the dental visit for the patient. With the advances in modern technology, we are now able to pinpoint the start of a potential problem much earlier in its evolution. The ability to do so is extremely important in being able to treat any issues prior to them becoming a major irreversible problem.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Post-Op Instructions</h2>
            <div class="picture12"></div>
            <p><a href="#">Instructions for Post-Op Care</a></p>
          </li>
